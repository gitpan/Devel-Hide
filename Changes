Revision history for Perl extension Devel::Hide.

0.0005  Wed May 30 2007
        - code reformatting with perltidy
        - now warns about already loaded modules
        - META.yml is auto-generated by Makefile.PL
        - a bit of refactoring to affect code readability
        - side effect: warnings are emitted at compile time
          and at every import call - a hopefully better timing

0.0004  Tue May 29 2007
        - slight implementation change preparing for the big time

0.0003  Wed Oct 4 2006

0.00_02 Sun Sep 25 2005
        - lifted the requirement on perl 5.8: now 5.6.1 will do 
          (because it may use File::Temp to fake bad modules)

        - first release to CPAN

0.00_00 Tue Sep 13 2005
